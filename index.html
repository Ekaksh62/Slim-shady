            Eminem, byname of Marshall Bruce Mathers III, (born October 17, 1972, St. Joseph, Missouri, U.S.), American rapper, record producer, 
            and actor who was known as one of the most-controversial and best-selling artists of the early 21st century. Mathers had a turbulent childhood, 
            marked by poverty and allegations of abuse. At age 14 he began rapping in clubs in Detroit, Michigan, and, when unexcused absences 
            kept him in the ninth grade for the third year, he quit school, determined to make it in hip-hop music.
